The nature is a beautiful thing.
It's home for all the living being.

When sun rises it becomes bright.
Then sun set it becomes night.

The birds sit on the tree.
Leading their lives very free.

We all should protect our nature.
From all the bad creature.

Spend your precious hours.
Looking at the nature's flowers.

The nature is a beautiful thing.
It's home for all the living being.
