The way to heaven,
Is thin and narrow.
Because of bad humans,
Who create grief and sorrow.

The way to hell,
are many and wide.
Because demons dwell,
And the way to heaven they hide.

The God had promised,
To show the result.
To the people who experienced,
the great difficult.

The people are few,
Who will see the scenery.
Of the heaven that blew,
The air of its greenery.

The people are many and more,
Who will be found fallen.
In the hell's locked up door,
Who had others property stolen.
