Early in the morning.
All the birds begin to sing.

All the birds sit on the tree.
And sing their song very sweetly.

The birds sing a song together.
They sing the song forever.

It sun began to rise and everything became bright.
The sun came out by showing its powerful light.

Early in the morning.
All the birds begin to sing.
