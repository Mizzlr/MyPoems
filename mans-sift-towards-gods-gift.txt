He who gives the preference,
To this attractive world.
He forgets the God's existence,
And the God has him sold.

God gave this world as a gift,
To the man to survive.
Every thing we had to sift,
To be fine when alive.

The world makes it's mad,
All those who prefer it.
In the madness, the God,
who gifted it shouldn't be forgot.

God wants us to worship him.
Not by chanting of hymns.
But by leading a lift with grim
And fearful to other humans.
