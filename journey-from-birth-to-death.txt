One who takes the birth,
Must receive the death.
The birth gives us the joy,
But the death will life destroy.

We know the life is here,
It's unknown, whether death is far or near.
One who is dead forever,
Can get back the magical soul never.

We work hard on the deck,
With the magical soul that can't go wreck.
From the death, the one who get scare,
Will in the life never dare.

On the deck you can get the pleasure.
After you die, you the original treasure.
The life has high and low pressure.
So, the length of the life has no measure.

When the time becomes precious,
Then we get too serious.
In the laziness, the time we spend,
While the time is scant, nobody with lend.
