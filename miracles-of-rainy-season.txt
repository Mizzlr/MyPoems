The collection of drops from the bay,
Is done by the clouds in such a way.
On the ground when each drop fell,
The ground sweat the sweetest smell.

Beautiful seven colors of the rainbow.
To amuse us with its fine show.
To cloud has no matter to fear.
But it loves to shower its tear.

Clouds float on the sky.
They shout and they cry.
After some days it will dry.
To bring rain again, it will try.

Clouds leak the rain.
And the human get the grain.
Think by using your brain.
Soul, does the cloud contain.
