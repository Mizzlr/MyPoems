The life we can get too long,
If we obey that the pride is wrong.
Two faces of a single coin.
One is bad and the other is good, which you can join.

Lead the life simple and smart.
By helping one with true heart.
Speak after you think,
Then the bad relation won't link.

The badness grows fast,
When we are single.
Suddenly, it will blast,
If with good friends we mingle.

Throw the badness which you keep.
Do many goodness before you forever sleep.
The life has to be brought.
To the victory of life has to be caught.

Kind full soul makes us the best.
The greedy soul makes us the worst.
Don't step in the bad way.
Or the kind full soul won't stay.

Sorrows can be for miles and miles
In the way keep your sweetest smiles.
Even the deepest sorrow,
Becomes less when we borrow.

The people in their future,
Should be kind full creature.
And be honest to whole nature.
To have long life with pleasure.

The tasty food which we eat.
The fresh air which we breath.
Again and again we repeat.
From God it's the treat.

Kindness makes us the prodigal.
But be the hard worker still.
The kindness that we prefer,
Should truly be recover.
