Invaluable blessing of mother,
Remains with in us forever.
Mothers chant which bless,
The value of that we can't guess.

The good we should not loose.
And the bad we should not choose.
The blessings are precious than gold.
That can't be destroyed till we hold.

To get the blessing, touch the feet.
True belief in them, won't cheat.
