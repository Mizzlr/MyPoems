The money that a man earns,
Must be the part of his learns.
Other's property we like to receive,
But men are greedy, they won't give.

The man who is greedy,
to kill others, he is always ready.
You can also become the prodigal to give.
And don't become beggar to receive.

The long life, we get from good health.
But, greed gives us non-lasting wrong wealth.
The way of now can be turned.
By having cheating and cruelty burned.

Now the life is just to get born,
To get the education for the learned.
So that money can be earned,
And the life is to be spanned.
