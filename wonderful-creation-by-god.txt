Nature is the greatest beauty.
Protecting it is our greatest duty.
Which was created by the God almighty.
So, we should clean all its dirty.

God created the sky for twinkling star.
To create the beauty He held them so far.
The stars appears throughout the night.
Then it disappears when the night meets bright.

The rays through windows make us to wake.
It turns the dead into alive for our sake.
The magical soul make us to take.
The task which we have to make.

When the wind began to blow.
And the water began to flow.
And the tree began to grow.
Then surely the nature will glow.

The singer performs the music.
The magician performs the magic.
Everyone faces something tragic.
Only for glad to come, as the logic.

There is a cut in continuous glad.
There is stop in continuous sad.
Not to be in feeling of always bad.
Other wise thou will become mad.

God created heaven so far.
To keep peace, without war.
God created hell so bad.
To keep man who made others sad.
