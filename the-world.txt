World is such a magnificent thing.
It builds shelter for all living being.

We are living in this world.
It has the season hot and cold.

It has the rivers and forest.
Where all the people swim and take rest.

In the season of hot many people become bald.
In the season of cold all the people get fold.

World is such a magnificent thing.
It builds shelter for all living being.
